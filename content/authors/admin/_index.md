My name is Ryu. I am an MA Interdisciplinary Studies student who studies Texts & Technology with TESOL at the University of Central Florida.
 
Recently, I earned a graduate cetrificate in TEFL (Teaching English as a Foregin Language) from UCF. Thus, I am currently focusing on Texts & Technology for the completion of my MA degree in Interdisciplinary Studies.
