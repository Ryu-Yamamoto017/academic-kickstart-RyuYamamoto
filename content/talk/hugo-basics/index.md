abstract: "On October 29th, 2020, I gave a talk and performance of Japanese-Okinawan kata to Dr. Walter Gaudnek's ART 3504C Intermediate Painting class. Dr. Gaudnek requested me to give a talk and demonstration of kata after having a brief conversation with me about the significance of kata in Japanese culture. This was largely due to Dr. Gaudnek's class focus on teaching and preserving various international art movements throughout the last three centuries.

For the painting class's students, I talked about the history of kata in Japanese-Okinawan martial arts and their connection to Ryukyu Buyo dancing (1). I then gave a performance of two kata choreographies used in the Okinawan martial arts: Gojushiho and Kosokun/Kushanku. On these kata choreographies' relationship to dance, Gojushiho is derived from an Amended Okinawan Royal Folk Dance (2) and Kosokun was a kata taught in the 1800's by royal performer, Chibana Chosho. In 1866, Chibana Chosho danced in the tora no ukanshin-udui held for King Sho Tai of the Ryukyu Kingdom (1). A link to my performance of Kosokun for the painting class is provided here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xq28_nsox6yP-bxQFhRtignfLJaeks9j/view?usp=sharing. (References: 1. Motobu N.
